= Guide to Devops using Openshift V3

== Objective
Create an example of DevOps environment, using the technologies below:

* Openshift V3
* Gitlab
* Maven Nexus
* Jenkins

== Prerequisites
This guide assume that you know the basics openshift concepts.
If not, check this training: http://github.com/openshift/training

== Accessing remotely
NOTE: Evict to execute commands inside the nodes (mainly on master node).
The default user on master is system:admin (oc whoami), so is recommended to
connect on openshift as a normal user.

Download the client: https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/ver=3.0.0.0/rhel---7/3.0.2.0/x86_64/product-downloads

== Environment
In my case, I created three virtual machines:

* node01 (master) - 3Gb memory - 2 Cpu
* node02 - 3Gb memory - 2 cpu
* node03 - 3Gb memory - 2 cpu

=== Domain
* In this guide the domain is: *devops.org*

* The openshift apps will use *cloud.devops.org*

So for a jenkins application the url will follow the syntax:

<app>-<project>.<openshift-domain> ->
jenkins-cidi.cloud.devops.org

== Projects
This guide use three projects, simulating *dev*, *qa* and *cidi* environments.

== Create projects

  oc new-project dev --display-name='Development'
  oc new-project qa --display-name='Quality Assurance'
  oc new-project cidi --display-name='Continuous Integration & Delivery'

== Topology (Regions and Zones)

  oc label node master.devops.org region="infra" zone="default"
  oc label node node02.devops.org region="hmg" zone="primary"
  oc label node node01.devops.org region="dsv" zone="primary"

== Volumes
Volume instructions in this guide, use link:create-storage.sh[]
script to create *nfs*, *(p)ersistence (v)olume* and *(p)ersistence (v)olume (c)laim*.
If you prefer to create without the scripts, the files .yaml is available
on each directory.

It can be created using:

  oc create -f <file>

== Relax Security

  oc edit scc

Your output from *oc get scc* should be like this:

  NAME         PRIV      CAPS      HOSTDIR   SELINUX    RUNASUSER
  privileged   true      []        true      RunAsAny   RunAsAny
  restricted   false     []        false     RunAsAny   RunAsAny
